# Roblox Lua Scripts

My Roblox Lua scripts and systems.

This repository contains scripts I’m working on while learning and building gameplay systems in Roblox, including movement, combat, and other mechanics.

## What’s in here
- Client-side scripts (input, animations, visuals)
- Server-side scripts (validation, damage, game logic)
- Small systems and experiments as I improve

## Notes
- Code is organized and commented as I learn
- Some files may include experimental or messy code while testing new functions
- Systems may change or get refactored over time
- Built for practice, learning, and future projects

More coming as I keep building.
